As a spoken langauge, it eventually stopped being used around 2000 BCE, but it continued to be used for writing up until the first century AD. Sumerian is considered an agglutinative language, meaning that words are built by attaching a series of prefixes and suffixes to a root. Sumerian uses the SOV format for word and sentence order, which means that the subject comes first, followed by the object, and then the verb. The language played a key role in early Mesopotamian culture; it was used for everything from keeping administrative records to legal documents and even religious texts and literature. One of the most famous works in Ancient History, the Epic of Gilgamesh, was first drafted in Sumerian as literature.""",

        "Ancient Greek": """Ancient Greek was spoken from around the 9th century BCE to the 6th century CE. It featured a complex system of noun cases, verb conjugations, and moods, including the optative and aorist. It is the language of Homer, Aristotle, and the New Testament. It differs significantly from Modern Greek.""",

        "Hieroglyphics": """Hieroglyphics is a system of complex illustrations created by the Ancient Egyptians over 5000 years ago. They consisted of several illustrations such as waves, human figures, and birds combined to form a complete sentence/thought. They originated during the Pre-dynastic era around 3200 BCE and were used all the way up until the end of Roman Occupation in Egypt in the 3rd century AD. Hieroglyphs were typically carved in Egyptian temple complexes and in funerary complexes as well. The most notable of these carvings are the ones carved at the Karnak Temple Complex in Luxor. Later, Hieroglyphs developed into a verbally written system of cursive script called Hieratic. This was used only in the government as a way of managing taxes, planned buildings, and workloads."""
